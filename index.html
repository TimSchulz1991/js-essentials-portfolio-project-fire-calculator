                        devoted

                        than traditional budgets and retirement plans would permit. Born out of the 1992 best-selling
                        book "Your Money or Your Life" by Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez, FIRE came to embody a core
                        premise of the book: People should evaluate every expense in terms of the number of working

                    <p class="small-screen-card">These calculation are based on the Four Percent Rule. It is a rule of
                        thumb
                        used to determine how much a retiree should withdraw from a retirement account each year. This
                        rule seeks to provide a steady income
                        stream to the retiree while also maintaining an account balance that keeps income flowing
                        through retirement. In simple terms, the rule states that you need to save 25 times your annual
                        expenses in order to be able to safely withdraw 4% from this amount annually, without harming
                        your overall account balance. You can read more <a
