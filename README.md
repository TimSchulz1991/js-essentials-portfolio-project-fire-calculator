# F.I.R.E. Calculator

This fully-responsive calculation tool helps people, who are interested in FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) to determine how much longer they still have to work and save money until they can live financially independent. This means that they can live off the returns of their investments for the rest of their lives. This page not only helps people with their FIRE-related calculations, but also gives them an introduction to the FIRE movement overall. 

The tool is easy to use, so that anyone can calculate their potential future retirement age with only a handful of values and get excited about the prospects of this (in case the results are exciting, that is).
